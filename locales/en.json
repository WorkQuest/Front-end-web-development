A work quest will help you find a quest next to you and your city. Do you need workers to carry out the goals? Just create a quest on the site of the work quest. The service assumes the warranty obligations for performing quests. Employer funds are kept with us , if the employee gives a confirmation of the performance of work, he receives a deposit of funds on his account. The system of ratings, reviews and a list of completed quests will help to easily find honest people and the best specialists.\n\n          Our goal is to simplify the communication between the employer and the employee, to help employ millions of people, to improve their financial situation, to solve the lifelong problem of finding reliable professionals in all sectors to create a progressive digital economy built on the principles of trust, mutual respect and the well-being of all its participants."

If a group member suffers an insurable loss, their claim is paid directly from the pool of money contributed by each member"
    },
    "faq3": {
      "question": "How do you do peer to peer insurance ?",
      "answer": "Ask for a “peer-to-peer” evaluation. In a peer-to-peer evaluation, your insurance fund will speak with another fund members about why the service or therapies are medically necessary. You can upload to the chat all the necessary documents and doctors' opinions, which will prove the legality of your case and create a vote for decision-making by the members of the foundation. If the majority of the fund votes in favor, you will receive the payout to your wallet."

      "question": "What will happen to the fund if the insured event does not occur within a year ?",
      "answer": "At the end of the year, all users will receive notifications with a vote where they will be asked to vote for the extension of the fund for another year, which will automatically double your fund and payments in the event of an insured event or divide the fund between the fund participants."

      "question": "How is the amount of payment from the insurance fund calculated ?",
      "answer": "An example of calculating the fund for the first year: Minimum protection - an annual premium of 1000 WUSD, payment in the event of an insured event 833.333333 WUSD.\n10 members of the fund * 1000 WUSD / 12 months = 833.333333 WUSD.\nIn case of continuation of the fund for the next year, the size of the fund and the insurance payment are doubled."
